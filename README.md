## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node

## Optimizations: 
I would have liked to have added a feature that also rearranged all of the translated messages by alphabetical order just like the primary function. If I went back, I think I would add in that new function on refresh as a little easter egg

## Lessons Learned: 
This app specifically taught me some new techniques to use in regards to CSS styling like column rules and some cool text effects
